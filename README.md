#HTML5_FlappyBird_Clone
  * This is a tutorial project in which I will be following
    along with Thomas Palef's fantastic blog post on building
    HTML5 platformer games with the Phaser HTML5 framework.

  * Here are links to Thomas' blog post and Phaser:

##Goals of this Project
  * Build a basic platformer for a browser environment.

  * Learn how to apply a framework like Phaser, which
    can greatly reduce the lines of code needed to
    create something complete.

  * Gain a better understanding of the process behind
    game development on a basic level.

##Tools and Utilities
  * In this project I will be using the basic project
    template Thomas provides at the following url:

http://lessmilk.com/flappy_bird/01/empty.zip

  * This zip folder contains a few files and assets
    to get us started:
    * phaser.min.js, the Phaser framework v2.0.5
    * index.html, where the game will be displayed
    * main.js, a file where we will write all our code
    * assets/, a folder with 2 images (bird.png, pipe.png)
